1 Help care for a friend
2 find a home, help him mend
3 Has a heart of gold
4 has to move - he's told.
5 Find a place, a nice new home
6 where people care - he can roam.
7 His eyes are lonely, can't you see
8 just wants love, somewhere to be.
9 Holds no grudges, has a happy heart
10 looking for a family, a brand new start.
11    Care for your friend, any way you can
12 a helping hand, a ride in a van.
13 Just a warm wish, tossed his way
14    may be all he needs to make his day.
